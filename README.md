# Security-Incident-Response-Template

ðŸŽ‰ **How to use this template**

Incidents are inevitable realities of any security program. A solid program will have a strong on-call culture and associated toolset to handle security incidents that show up.  We have created two valuable templates for handling incidents and disseminating timely status updates. The first one is an investigation template, to be used while handling an incident. Second is a short executive summary, to be used to send periodic updates to customers and or stakeholders. 

Please note these templates are configurable. Readers should feel free to make a copy and change/edit for their audience and needs. If you have existing templates (we hope you do), feel free to take any helpful elements.
